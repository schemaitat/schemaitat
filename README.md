# Hi there, I am Andr√© üëã


## üë§ About me


I am Andr√©, a data scientist with a strong background in pure mathematics and a Ph.D. in the field. I have successfully transitioned into software engineering and data science, combining my theoretical expertise with practical experience to solve real-world problems.


Currently, I am interested in exploring the interactions between Rust and Python. This is inspired by the beautiful [polars](https://pola.rs/) project, which in my opinion sets the new standard for mid-size data processing. I am also actively learning Rust to understand the inner workings of such projects and eventually become more proficient in a system close programming language.


In addition, I specialize in the data engineering and machine learning modules of Databricks.


## üè¢ Work


- Univerity of M√ºnster:
    - Conducted research in pure mathematics, specifically in C*-algebras.
    - Taught mathematics courses.

- Atruvia:
    - As a part of the main IT service provider for the Volksbanken in Germany, I led the migration of a monolithic z/OS (mainframe) SAS Base application to an on-prem private cloud (OpenShift) [SAS Viya](https://www.sas.com/de_de/software/viya.html) deployment. SAS Viya is a high performance AI and Analytics platform.
    - Introduced mathematical models to enhance the AML (anti money laundering) monitoring software used by over 900 Volksbanken in Germany.
    - Gained valuable experience in platform-related software engineering and Kubernetes.

- flaschenpost (recent):
    - Currently working at Flaschenpost SE, an online grocery store in Germany with its roots in M√ºnster.
    - Focused on optimizing last-mile delivery through the development and operation of various machine learning (forecasting) models.
